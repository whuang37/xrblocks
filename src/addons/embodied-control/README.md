# embodied-control

Programmatic embodied-user control for [xrblocks](https://github.com/google/xrblocks).

`embodied-control` lets tests and demos drive an XR Blocks scene through the
same surfaces a user has: locomotion, head/camera rotation, left and right hand
motion, hand poses, and WebXR-like select gestures. It is local-only and does
not provide observation capture or remote networking.

The addon follows the normal XR Blocks script lifecycle: construct it, add it to
the scene before `xb.init()`, and let dependency injection provide `Core`,
`Simulator`, and `Camera`.

---

## Quick start

```ts
import * as xb from 'xrblocks';
import {EmbodiedControl} from 'xrblocks/addons/embodied-control/index.js';

const embodied = new EmbodiedControl();

xb.add(embodied);
await xb.init();

embodied.applyControl({
  rightHand: {visible: true},
});

await embodied.step({
  durationMs: 250,
  control: {
    locomotion: {move: [0, 0, -0.25]},
    rightHand: {move: [0, 0, -0.12]},
  },
});
```

`applyControl()` applies the control immediately and leaves the normal frame
loop alone. Use it in live apps, scripts, and demos where XR Blocks should keep
rendering normally.

`step()` applies a control over a duration, advances the core frame loop, and
resolves when movement is complete. By default, `EmbodiedControl` pauses the
core after initialization so frames advance only when `step()` is called. This
is useful for repeatable tests.

For visual demos, pass `realTime: true` so the browser paints intermediate
frames while a step is executing:

```ts
const embodied = new EmbodiedControl({
  realTime: true,
});
```

---

## Action schema

Both `applyControl()` and `step()` use the same compound control schema.
Locomotion and both hands can move during the same control.

```ts
await embodied.step({
  durationMs: 500,
  control: {
    locomotion: {
      move: [0, 0, -0.2],
      rotate: [0, 15, 0],
    },
    rightHand: {
      move: [0, 0, -0.18],
      selectStart: true,
    },
    leftHand: {
      move: [-0.05, 0, 0],
    },
  },
});
```

### Locomotion

```ts
locomotion: {
  move?: [strafeMeters, riseMeters, forwardMeters];
  rotate?: [pitchDegrees, yawDegrees, rollDegrees];
}
```

Movement is camera-relative and is distributed over the whole step duration.

### Hands

```ts
rightHand: {
  move?: [xMeters, yMeters, zMeters];
  rotate?: [pitchDegrees, yawDegrees, rollDegrees];
  selectStart?: boolean;
  selectEnd?: boolean;
  rotations?: SimulatorHandPoseRotations;
  visible?: boolean;
}
```

Hand `move` and `rotate` are relative to the current simulator controller pose.
`rotations` applies sparse simulator hand joint rotations in radians.

Use `selectStart` and `selectEnd` for WebXR-like hand selection. In the
simulator these call `setLeftHandPinching()` / `setRightHandPinching()`, which
emits the normal XR Blocks `selectstart` / `selectend` events and updates the
controller selected state. This is different from passing raw pinching
`rotations`, which only changes the visual hand pose.

---

## High-level actions

In addition to raw coordinate-relative `step()` controls, `EmbodiedControl`
exposes high-level methods that perform target math and frame stepping:

```ts
// Teleport directly in front of the yellow cube.
await embodied.teleportTo(cube, {distance: 1.2, faceTarget: true});

// Smoothly turn user head to look at target at 1.5 radians/sec.
await embodied.lookAtTarget(cube, {velocity: 1.5});

// Smoothly point right controller at target at 1.5 radians/sec.
await embodied.pointTo(1, cube, {velocity: 1.5}); // 1 = right hand

// Smoothly extend right hand to cube at 0.5 meters/sec.
await embodied.reachTo(1, cube, {velocity: 0.5});

// Perform click (selectStart + selectEnd sequence).
await embodied.click(1);
```

All high-level methods return `Promise<void>` and resolve when the movement or
gesture sequence is complete.

- **`teleportTo(target, options)`**: Teleports the camera to coordinates or
  facing an object. Options: `distance` (default 1.5m), `faceTarget` (default
  true), and `snapToGround` (default false).
- **`lookAtTarget(target, options)`**: Rotates the camera to look at the target.
  Options: `velocity` in radians/second; if omitted, snaps instantly in 1
  frame.
- **`pointTo(handIndex, target, options)`**: Rotates the controller locally in
  camera space to point directly at the target. Options: `velocity` in
  radians/second; if omitted, snaps instantly in 1 frame.
- **`reachTo(handIndex, target, options)`**: Moves the controller position
  toward the target. Options: `velocity` in meters/second; if omitted, moves
  instantly.
- **`click(handIndex, options)`**: Simulates click gesture press and release.
  Options: `durationMs` (default 200ms).

## Local tests

The addon is intentionally imperative. Await movement completion, then assert
against your app state, scene objects, scripts, or normal XR Blocks APIs:

```ts
await embodied.pointTo(1, button);
await embodied.click(1);

expect(game.score).toBe(1);
```

Only one step may run at a time. If a second step is requested while another is
active, `EmbodiedControlBusyError` is thrown.

---

## Live app control

For a normally running app, disable `autoPause` and call `applyControl()` from
your script, UI, or scheduler:

```ts
const embodied = new EmbodiedControl({
  autoPause: false,
});

embodied.applyControl({
  locomotion: {rotate: [0, 10, 0]},
  rightHand: {selectStart: true},
});
```

`applyControl()` does not call `core.stepFrame()` and resolves no action result.

## Sample

See `samples/embodied_control/` for a sidebar-driven simulator sample. It
disables manual simulator controls and runs locomotion, hand motion, and
pinch-select steps only through `EmbodiedControl`.

## Public surface

- `EmbodiedControl` — XR Blocks `Script` that exposes `applyControl()` and
  `step()`.
- `EmbodiedControlExecutor` — lower-level executor used by the script and by
  tests or custom harnesses.
- `EmbodiedControlStep` / `XRCompoundControl` / `HandControl` /
  `LocomotionControl` — JSON-compatible action types.
