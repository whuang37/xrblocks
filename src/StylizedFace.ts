/**
 * StylizedFace: a tiny face primitive that any avatar can adopt. Draws
 * a pair of static eyes and a parametric mouth onto a single canvas
 * texture mapped to a forward-facing plane. The mouth morphs from a
 * thin closed line into a wider oval as the speaker opens up; the eyes
 * occasionally blink so the host head reads as alive.
 *
 * Extends `Script` so the xrblocks scripts manager calls `update()`
 * every frame — that's how the blink loop keeps animating even when
 * nothing is driving the mouth (no incoming lipsync stream, no
 * `setVisemes()` calls). A face with neither audio nor blendshape feed
 * is still a face that blinks.
 *
 * The plane sits flush with the front of the host head sphere on the
 * local -Z side (WebXR head-forward convention) and never z-fights with
 * the head itself. Construct, parent to a head pivot, done. To remove
 * the face from the scene call `parent.remove(face)`; `dispose()`
 * releases the canvas texture and geometry.
