# lipsync

Audio-driven avatar mouths for [xrblocks](https://github.com/google/xrblocks).

`lipsync` turns any avatar with a head pivot into a face that visibly mouths
along to a `MediaStream`. The mouth, eyes, and an occasional blink are drawn
to a small canvas decal sitting flush with the front of the head. The mouth
shape is driven each frame from heuristic vowel formants. No model download,
no ML runtime.

The reason this addon exists is the pairing with
[`netblocks`](../netblocks/README.md): every remote peer's voice
`MediaStream` drives their own avatar's mouth, so a shared room stops being
silent spheres and becomes faces that visibly speak.

A standalone web demo of the same idea (single user, lower-fidelity DSP)
lives at <https://salmanmkc.github.io/audio-avatar-lipsync/>.

## Quick start

Single-user mic into any `Object3D` head:

```ts
import * as xb from 'xrblocks';
import {LipsyncMouth} from 'xrblocks/addons/lipsync';

const face = new xb.StylizedFace({showEyes: false});
headPivot.add(face);
const driver = new LipsyncMouth(myMicStream, {target: face});
headPivot.add(driver);
```

That's it. Once `driver` is in the scene graph, the xrblocks scripts manager
calls `init()` once and `update(time)` every frame on it (and on the face
itself, so the eyes keep blinking). `dispose()` runs on the next sync after
either is removed from the scene; the driver does NOT dispose the `target`
face — the caller owns it.

`StylizedFace` is an xrblocks core primitive (`xb.StylizedFace`): a flat
canvas decal anchored to the host head's local `-Z` (face direction). It
defaults to a 10 cm radius head; pass `headRadius` if your avatar's head
is bigger or smaller.

## Netblocks integration

Netblocks's `RemoteUserAvatar` already attaches a `face` (a `StylizedFace`)
to every remote peer out of the box, so you don't have to create one
yourself. Just point `LipsyncMouth` at it:

```ts
import * as THREE from 'three';
import {LipsyncMouth} from 'xrblocks/addons/lipsync';

protected override onSession(session) {
  const sharedCtx = THREE.AudioContext.getContext();
  session.voice.onTrack((peerId, stream) => {
    const user = session.users.get(peerId);
    if (!user) return;
    const driver = new LipsyncMouth(stream, {
      target: user.avatar.face,
      audioContext: sharedCtx,
    });
    user.avatar.add(driver);
  });
}
```

`session.voice.onTrack` is additive, so this runs alongside (not instead
of) netblocks' own `SpatialVoice.attach`, and peers both see mouths and
hear each other.

See [`samples/netblocks/`](samples/netblocks/) for a working multi-peer demo.

## Lifecycle and ownership

The caller owns the `MediaStream`. `LipsyncMouth.dispose()` disconnects
its audio nodes but never stops tracks. If you got the stream from
`getUserMedia`, stop the tracks yourself when you're done with them.

The caller also owns the `AudioContext` when one is passed in. Always pass
`audioContext` to reuse a shared context for any scene with more than one
mouth, because browsers cap contexts at around 6 per page. If you omit the
option, `LipsyncMouth` creates its own context and closes it on dispose. A
caller-supplied context is never closed by the addon.

Instances are one-shot. After dispose, construct a new `LipsyncMouth`. Do
not re-add the disposed instance to the scene.

## Samples

`samples/puppet/` is a single-user puppet head you can talk to. Opens in
seconds, no server.

`samples/netblocks/` is the multiplayer demo. Open it in two browser tabs
or two devices in the same room to see each peer's voice drive their own
avatar's mouth.

## How the mouth is computed

Each frame, an `AnalyserNode` gives us byte frequency and time-domain
buffers. `computeAudioFeatures` extracts RMS, voicing, F1, F2, and a few
band energies from those. `FormantVisemeMapper` maps F1/F2 to six viseme
weights (`jawOpen`, `aa`, `oo`, `oh`, `ee`, `consonant`) with
frame-rate-independent smoothing (`1 - exp(-dt / tau)`) so 60, 72, 90, and
120 Hz refresh rates all look identical. `LipsyncMouth` writes the weights
to its `target` (typically `xb.StylizedFace`), which re-rasterises a
256×256 canvas (one dark mouth ellipse and two optional eye dots) and
uploads it as a `CanvasTexture` on a small plane sitting flush with the
head sphere.

The pipeline is split into pure modules (`MfccExtractor`,
`FormantVisemeMapper`, `computeAudioFeatures`) so the heuristic mapper can
be replaced later by a small ML viseme mapper consuming the same
`AudioFeatures` plus MFCC vector, without touching the addon's public
surface. The face primitive (`xb.StylizedFace`) lives in xrblocks core so
any consumer — not just lipsync — can drive it.

## Caveats

Vowel detection from F1/F2 is heuristic. It covers the dominant shapes
well enough that you can tell when someone is talking, but it won't beat a
proper phoneme model on accuracy. The `MfccExtractor` is exported so a
model-based mapper can slot in.

High-pitched voices (children, soprano singers) push formants up and can
reduce vowel separation. Speaker-relative normalisation would help here
and would be a sensible follow-up.

Microphone access requires HTTPS in modern browsers. Use `localhost` or a
real cert for cross-device testing.

Browsers can drop a `MediaStreamAudioSourceNode` unless the same stream is
also being pumped by an `HTMLMediaElement`. `LipsyncMouth` creates a muted
off-DOM `<audio>` primer per stream to keep WebAudio alive. This is the
same workaround `SpatialVoice` uses.

## Public surface

The main export is `LipsyncMouth`. It's an `xb.Script` you construct with
a `MediaStream` and a `target` (anything with `setVisemes(VisemeWeights)`,
typically `xb.StylizedFace` or `user.avatar.face` on a netblocks avatar).
Constructor options: `target` (required), `audioContext`, `fftSize`,
`silenceThreshold`, `silenceHoldMs`. The driver never disposes the target
— the caller owns it.

The face primitive `StylizedFace` lives in xrblocks core (`import {StylizedFace}
from 'xrblocks'`); construct one yourself for standalone use, or read it
off `RemoteUserAvatar.face` for multiplayer. It takes `headRadius`,
`textureSize`, and `showEyes`.

The lower-level pieces (`FormantVisemeMapper`, `MfccExtractor`,
`computeAudioFeatures`) and the types (`VisemeWeights`, `VisemeTarget`,
`FormantVisemeMapperOptions`, `MfccExtractorOptions`, `AudioFeatures`,
`AudioFeatureInputs`) are exported as well, so a future ML mapper can plug
into the same pipeline. `LipMetrics` and `StylizedFaceOptions` come from
xrblocks core alongside `StylizedFace`.
